# Image-Encryption-using-Perlinnoise-Matrix
Data encryption is required in the majority of enterprises since data security is a vital component in maintaining the security of data and information in many institutions. Encryption also helps to keep data confidential and accurate while it is being delivered across communication channels. 
Many academics have determined that the key is the most important element in data encryption due to the role of the keys used in encryption as a significant component in the strength of the algorithm and boost its security in the majority of encryption algorithms. Its significance lies in the non-duplication of keys to ensure better results and theoretical impossibility to break. In this research project, we make an effort to summarize, analyze, and evaluate a number of the publications that were utilized to develop the keys and implemented on it an image.
